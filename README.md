## 🎮💻 CodeQuest: Learn Programming Through RPG Adventure  

*A gamified learning app where programming progress unlocks adventures in a Zelda-like world.*  

---

## 🌟 Core Concept  
**Mission**: Teach programming via an immersive RPG (inspired by *Zelda NES*), where code challenges directly impact gameplay.  

### Key Principles  
- **Deep Gamification**: Learning feels like playing, with pedagogical value for educators.  
- **Adaptive Paths**: Customizable tracks (e.g., JavaScript/Python) based on skill level.

## 🎯 Features  

### 🧠 Learning Methodology  
1. **Conceptual Analogies**:  
   - Ex: Classes/instances ≈ jet blueprints vs. physical jets.  
2. **Code Progression**:  
   - Simple (`Pessoa`, `Animal`) → Realistic (`User`).  

### 🎮 Game Mechanics  
| Feature               | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **In-Game Coding**    | Fix "bugs" in the world by writing real code.                               |
| **NPC Evolution**     | Characters level up as you learn (e.g., an assistant gains new abilities).  |
| **Multi-Mode Gameplay** | RPG adventure, turn-based battles, TCG elements, and tower defense.        |

### 🌍 Lore & World  
- **Setting**: Medieval world with hidden programming artifacts (ancient code snippets, magic loops).  
- **Mystery**: Is this a simulation? Why do futuristic relics exist?

| Component          | Technology                          | Purpose                                  |
|--------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Frontend**       | Flutter (Dart)                     | Cross-platform performance + animations. |
| **Game Engine**    | Flame + Rive                       | Pixel-art RPG mechanics.                 |
| **Content Tools**  | Tiled                              | Pre-built map generation (no proc-gen).  |

### 🤖 AI Integration  
- Dynamic difficulty adjustment.  
- Code assistant (answers questions in-game).

## 👥 Community & Social  
- **Profiles**:  
  - GitHub/LinkedIn sync for certifications.  
  - Custom avatars and guilds (study groups).  
- **Async Co-Op**:  
  - Leave code hints as "messages in bottles" for others.  
  - Build shared structures in the world.  

---

## 🚀 MVP Roadmap  
1. **Phase 1**: Offline RPG + basic programming challenges.  
2. **Phase 2**: Async multiplayer (bots, shared maps).  
3. **Future**: Real-time co-op and advanced tracks (AI, DevOps).
